# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Really cool text-based adventure game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It's going to be a texted-base game inside vscode most likely.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will have classes to play like priest,rouge,warrior, etc. The story will go differentl depending on what class you choose. Each class has their own two starter items that they can pick later on. The items they pick can change the stats of the player. Also the decision you make will affect how people around you see you.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
I haven't thought of cooperating with another final project class.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
I am working solo

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO I would like to get the base game down. I would hope to finish one of the classes story line. Get the inventory stuff down and hope to make multiple choices for the players to have fun

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO A better outcome would me to have 2 or 3 classes done.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO Having all the classes done with a functioning stats system.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO My next step is to see what is the most important and see what I would have to do first. I believe I got the story down but implenting changign stats and different weapons will be a little difficult. I think watching youtube videos on them will help me a lot.
