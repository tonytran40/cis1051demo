Hello! I changed my final project to be a discord bot because I believe a discord bot can be improved and be more useful than a text-based game. I also realized that I could do a text-based game on a discord bot aswell.

Some of the challenges I faced when making a discord bot is obivously trying to learn all the attribute into making a bot. Some weren't too but because it was pretty easy like sending a message through the bot through certain commands.

I wanted to use an API to make the bot better but I had to wait for it to get approved by the game.

The one problem I really had trouble with was pass multiple variables through functions. With discords api and bot, it was really hard to get used to and I still learn to be proficent at it.
